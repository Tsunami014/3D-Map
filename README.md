# ASE Assessment 1

## Features
 - Displays a 3D map of the chosen location
 - Displays government money and housing prices
## How to install
Ensure you have a version of python3 and it has pip, then run `pip install requirements.txt`.
## How to run

**THERE ARE 2 FILES**:
 - `main.py` is the one with 3D which is recommended
 - `mainold.py` is the one in 2D which is still cool if you want to have a look, but this file *is not* the main project file.
