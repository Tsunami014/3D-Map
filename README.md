# ASE Assessment 1
## Overview
This project is a very simple version of sim city or civilization. It uses a map of Australia pulled from an API, and starts you off with current stats from Australia (economics, etc.).
## How to install
Ensure you have a version of python3 and it has pip, then run `pip install requirements.txt`.
## How to run
Type in the terminal `python3 main.py`in this directory or double click on the file in the file explorer.

**THERE ARE 2 FILES**:
 - `main.py` is the one with 3D which is recommended
 - `main2d.py` is the one in 2D which is still cool if you want to have a look, but this file *is not* the main project file.
## APIs used:
 - [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/)
 - [Nextzen](https://www.nextzen.org/)
// TODO: In the final game implement a credit thingo for the APIs as they want that
