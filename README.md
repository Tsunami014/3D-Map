# ASE Assessment 1
## Overview
This project aims to provide you with a method for finding a city you would like to live in through displaying a 3D map of the city in addition to the price of housing and the amount of money the government has.
## Features
 - Displays a 3D map of the chosen location
 - Displays government money and housing prices
## How to install
Ensure you have a version of python3 and it has pip, then run `pip install requirements.txt`.
## How to run
Type in the terminal `python3 main.py` in this directory or double click on the file in the file explorer.

**THERE ARE 2 FILES**:
 - `main.py` is the one with 3D which is recommended
 - `mainold.py` is the one in 2D which is still cool if you want to have a look, but this file *is not* the main project file.
### Controls
(These are the same in both `main.py` and `mainold.py`)
 - `←`/`↑`/`→`/`↓` - move viewpoint
 - `,`/`.` - zoom in/out
 - `<esc>` - quit
