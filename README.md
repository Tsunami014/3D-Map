# ASE Assessment 1
## GAME PLAN FOR NOW:
 - A very simple version of sim city or civilization but where it pulls data of Australia's current status and map to use as the starting point.
 - It will be in 3d with a locked camera angle (but with 2 camera angles; perspective or top down)
## APIs used:
 - [Nominatim](https://nominatim.org/)
 - [Nextzen](https://www.nextzen.org/)
// TODO: In the final game implement a credit thingo for the APIs as they want that
